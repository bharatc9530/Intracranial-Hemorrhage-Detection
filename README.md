# **Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection**
### *Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection using Deep Learning (DL)*

This [project](https://akhithababu.github.io/ICH-detection/) focus on automated Deep-learning solution for detection and classification of [Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage#:~:text=Intracranial%20bleeding%20occurs%20when%20a,such%20as%20a%20ruptured%20aneurysm.) using [medical images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging) of brain 🧠 X-Ray Scans which are in the format of [DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/) (.dcm).
